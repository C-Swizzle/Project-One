Design: On one page, the user can enter a location and instantly see the weather forecast for that area over the next 7 days, if there are obstructions on the road the user is taking, and accommodation suggestions for airbnb and camp sites. This web application uses APIs from OpenCage, Dark Sky, airbnb, Caltrans, and Active. The display is built on a bootstrap grid with CSS, and the backend is powered by JavaScript and JQuery.       


  1. Who is your target audience?
    As a user, I want to check realtime weather forecasts, availability for campgrounds, and see any and all danger alerts along the highway. Targets anyone planning or currently on a trip with questions about reaching and what to expect at the destination.

  2. What is the problem that the product will address?
    As a user, I want to be able to search a location and easily know what environmental occurence may affect my travels. 

  3. What is the primary goal of the product?
    As a user, I want to see a 7 day forecast of weather in my area or area that I search for, trafic issues, and accomodation suggestions.

  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
    As a user, I want to check for open and campgrounds with vacancy near me.
    As a user, I want to see if foul weather may change my camping plans, and help book an alternative accomodation through airbnb.
